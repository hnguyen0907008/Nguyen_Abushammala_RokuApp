On this branch, I make all the medias accessible for everyone. Users just need to click the thumbnail and the details about that movie/tv show/song will pop up.
However, the design for the thumbnails and for the audio details are not completed. There are no audio controls either.

The workflow:
dev.nxh.accessAllMedias - making videos and audios accessible using Vue
dev.nxh.designAllMedias - complete the design of all medias
dev.nxh.mediaFunctionality - adding more controls like pause, rewind, etc
main - merge everything together. The most up-to-date branch
