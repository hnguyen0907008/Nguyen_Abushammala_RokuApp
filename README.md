# Nguyen_Abushammala_RokuApp

On this branch, I make all the medias accessible for everyone. Users just need to click the thumbnail and the details about that movie/tv show/song will pop up in a lightbox. 
However, the design for the thumbnails and for the audio details are not completed. 

Current branch:
- dev.nxh.accessAllMedias - making videos and audios accessible using Vue

Future branches
- dev.nxh.designAllMedias - complete the design of all medias
- dev.nxh.mediaFunctionality - adding more controls like pause, rewind, etc
