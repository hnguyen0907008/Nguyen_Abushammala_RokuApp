On this branch, I make all the medias accessible for everyone. Users just need to click the thumbnail and the details about that movie/tv show/song will pop up in a lightbox. 
However, the design for the thumbnails and for the audio details are not completed.

After submitting, I actually removed some unecessary css files and pushed it on Sunday to reduce the file size.
